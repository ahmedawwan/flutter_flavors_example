# Flutter Flavors Example  

This project shows how to set up **multiple environments in Flutter** (Dev, Staging, Production) using:  
- Android **productFlavors**  
- iOS **schemes**  
- Separate `main.dart` entry points  
- A **FlavorConfig model** to centralize API URLs, keys, and environment-specific values  

Perfect for developers who need clean builds for QA, testing, and production releases without duplicating code.
